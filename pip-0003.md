# Abstract
The current state of the Peerplays blockchain requires, in order to create
or modify a `sport_object`, `event_group_object` or an `event_object` to
have the permission of at least 50% + 1% of witnesses on the blockchain.

This is inconvinient and requires a higher payload on the blockchain,
because the operations are only executed through a proposal. 

To reduce the payload and increase the user friendliness, the manager
attribute for the mentioned `objects` is introduced. 

# Rational
Users who created a `sport`, hence are owners of this object should have
the right to modify it and the `objects` in the hierarchy beneith. This means
`event_group_object` and `event_object`, which are allways linked to a `sport_object`,
should also be modifiable by the manager of the `sport_object`. 

Furthermore the manager should be able to assign a manager for the mentioned objects
in the hierarchy below. So the manager of `event_group_object` can assign a manager
for an `event_object`.

This increases the possibilities for sport creators to operate in hierarchical structures.

# Specifications
The manager is a member of `sport_object`, `event_group_object` and the `event_object`.
It contains the `account_id_type` of the `manager` account. 

All `x_create/update/delete_operation` where `x` is of type `sport`, `event_group` or
`event` are modified in a way that if a `fee_paying_account` is set, this `fee_paying_account`
is used to be compared to the `manager` in the targeted `object`. 

The only exception of this is the `sport_create_operation`, which can only be used in the normal
manner by executing it through a proposal.

The old behaviour of the `operations` still persist. So they can be still executed through
a proposal.

# Summary for Voters
This PIP proposes a way to execute `sport_object`, `event_group_object`
and `event_object` related `operations` without the permission of 50% + 1% of 
`witnesses` on the Peerplays blockchain, by introducing the manager for the mentioned 
`objects`.
