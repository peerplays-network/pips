# Abstract
In order to facilitate the transfer of token operations from the Peerplays blockchain to and from another blockchain a mechanism is necessary which will tie directly into GPOS in order to accomplish a full inter-blockchain communication mechanism. 

While the Peerplays blockchain currently relies on witnesses in order to send oracalized data into the blockchain, it is preferred in order to add resilience and to reduce the overall load on witnesses to instead create a new consensus arm in Peerplays. 

Sidechain Operator Nodes (SONs) are elected by Peerplays PPY holders to facilitate the role of acting as oracles to multiple blockchains, and having authority and permissions to enable certain blockchain assets and operations to pass to and from the Peerplays blockchain.

There should be a minimum of 15 SONs, however it is up to the voters to decide how many SONs should operate beyond this. When elected they will have authority to carry out certain operations within Peerplays relating to the issuing of assets that represent other blockchains, as well as any specialized operations within Peerplays intended to pass through to Peerplays sidechains.

# Motivation
There are two primary motivators, tokenized sidechain, and horizontal scaling and smart contract support through sidechains. First, the introduction of Bitcoin Sidechain as presented in PIP #4 provides an exciting opportunity for the Peerplays blockchain to be able to natively support Bitcoin within the Peerplays blockchain. Second, the need to utilize smart contracts as provided by multiple platforms such as: EOS, Ethereum, Neo, Tron, HyperLedger Fabric, and Steem. 

The ability for game developers to utilize the native cryptocurrency of their choice within Peerplays without having to use custodial mechanisms and centralized exchanges will provide a more secure experience for end users, and greater flexibility to make Peerplays the platform of choice as a public blockchain to build games on.

The ability for dApp developers to be able to utilize the blockchain technology of their choice for core blockchain game development will allow Peerplays to remain ubiquitous and agnostic in being a platform of choice for gaming development in blockchain. This also will enable the Peerplays blockchain as an ecosystem to scale in unlimited capacity.

# Rational
The requirements for SONs have assumed that the operations for GPOS implementation have been completed. The SONs mechanism can only work effectively in a voting chain where more voters are engaged and participating in the process of securing the blockchain.

Building a sidechain is no simple task and has seen many different theories on how it could/should be accomplished. The decisions made to take this route are derived from over two years experience both in design consideration and coded prototypes. The objective from the beginning was to introduce native Bitcoin into the Peerplays blockchain in such a way as to make it a seamless experience. In other words, sending BTC to a Bitcoin generated address that exists in some form inside of Peerplays would be the same as any native transaction using the Bitcoin blockchain. As far as the end user is concerned at all points in their interactions, they are using Bitcoin and have access to their own private keys. 

eXeBlock Technology Corp. had developed a BTC sidechain which was designed to work with the witnesses of the Peerplays blockchain. The greatest challenge always came down to who and where the private keys that interacted with the Bitcoin blockchain would be stored/managed/maintained in a trustless manner. In exploring HTLC options we recognize the same issues exist under this scenario. While the eXeBlock solution proved to be effective as a sidechain, it was not without certain technical challenges due to the way witness changeover took place in Peerplays and Graphene in general. 

We have also taken into consideration the fact that witnesses within peerplays already have a considerable load with oracalizing data for BookiePro, and that adding on sidechain may become too onerous. What was preferable for resilience and for ensured stability would be a dedicated mechanism outside of witnesses whose sole operation was to maintain and ensure the process of blockchain communication from one to another were maintained. 

By introducing a new arm of delegation into Peerplays called SONs, we are able to expand the participants in the blockchain operating beyond just witnesses (although a witness can be a SON also, its up to the voters). This provides greater resilience and overcomes a technical issue which was observed in the first versions of Sidechain which were developed by eXeBlock Technology Corp. due to attaching the process to witnesses.

SONs operate as a permissioned authority which will have operational rewards that are equal to both their voting weight, and their uptime/participation in signing of transactions. The reasoning for taking this type of model was to ensure that the fees associated with maintaining SONs can be kept minimal or free for the end user and are instead maintained by Peerplays blockchain rewards. 

In considering the design, we also needed to think beyond just BTC in the analysis due to the increasing demand to introduce dynamic smart contract capabilities to Peerplays. The SONs mechanism allows for maximum flexibility in order to allow for messaging to and from Peerplays to pass through to other blockchains by way of consensus. With the minimum of 15 and an unlimited maximum, there will be enough diversity and decentralization of operators to validate the signing of all communications. 

Because we want this to be a protocol that is extensive enough to support multiple blockchains, putting the permissions and authority specifically into this function of the network allows for SONs to address the network requirements that are unique to this operation.

# Specifications
The SONs will require a core update to the Peerplays protocol. The capabilities of the SONs will be specifically limited to the transfer of coins from one network to another initially. However, the same process over time can be used to enable operations to become exported from the core Peerplays blockchain. Because Peerplays core blockchain is built with static protocols, SONs will only be required to interact with smart contracts outside of the Peerplays blockchain to communicate operations. For example, if a tournament of Rock, Paper, Scissors (RPS) was to take place on Peerplays and won, if a condition exists in the EOS blockchain to interact with those results if the permission layer has been set to enable transfer of funds into EOS blockchain natively, this can take place. Effectively this would allow for the operations to take place on Peerplays, while allowing the smart contract dapp owner to use EOS for their interface, making the functions of Peerplays a library of gaming elements they can use on their smart contract platform of choice such as EOS, Ethereum, Hyperledger, Neo, Tron, and others.

## SONs Voting
Each SON will be voted for by Peerplays PPY holders who are participating in voting. Each SON when processing inter blockchain communications (IBC) will carry a percentage of weight in the signing based on the votes they have received. For example if among 21 SONs there are 9 which account for more than ⅔ of the total stake voting, then transactions will be capable of being approved by only those 9 even if the other 11 did not participate in signing the transactions. This **Cross Chain Consensus Protocol** (CCCP) will ensure that every communication validation that took place between chains took place based on consensus of Peerplays and the consensus of the other blockchain.

## SONs Transaction Signing
Every IBC request will require signed consensus by at least ⅔ of the vote stake weighted votes for the SONs which are signers in an authority virtual account.

## SONs Rewards
A daily rewards pool will be established for SONs that will be paid out daily based on transactions signed and weight of voting. Both approved and rejected transactions shall be included as part of the total transaction count. Recommended starting balance should be 200 PPY daily.

## SONs Token Issuing
Similar to the mechanism created on PIP#4, SONs will be given the permissions and authority to enable counterparty contracts for IBC to access Peerplays tokens via the authority account they sign approvals through. 

## SONs Messaging Layer
Every IBC will be setup with the permission of the SONs based on 100% participation in order to enable a new communication layer with Peerplays. This comes in the form of a proposed transaction provided by a dapp or blockchain representative. The transaction includes within it details on the sidechain including the public signing keys/account, and/or address of the smart contract, and other RPC details that may be necessary in order to interface with the blockchain and/or Dapp. Upon each SONs signing the associated blockchain/smart contract will provide a response validating the correct setup. Once 100% is achieved the IBC is established and made active. 

## SONs Smart Contracts
A series of templates should be created for all the blockchains SONs will support if the IBC is intended for a blockchain which has smart contract support such as EOSIO or EVM. In regards to protocol only blockchains hardfork updates using code such as illustrated in PIP #4 will be required to introduce them into Peerplays. It is recommended that the first implementation of SONs work with the Bitcoin sidechain as designed in PIP #4. 

## SONs Error Handling
All transactions will have fees associated with them. Ongoing communications will require at least ⅔ of voting weight approval thereby ensuring a resilient communication link between blockchains. However, in the event that this consensus fails the transaction will be rejected within a short timeout period and simply expire. Should SONs find there to be an issue with a particular IBC, they can switch their voting to rejecting all transactions. A series of templates should be created for all the blockchains SONs will support if the IBC is intended for a blockchain which has smart contract support such as EOSIO or EVM. In regards to protocol only blockchains hard fork updates using code such as illustrated in PIP #4 will be required to introduce them into Peerplays. It is recommended that the first implementation of SONs work with the Bitcoin sidechain as designed in PIP #4.

# Summary for Peerplays Participants
The introduction of SONs to the Peerplays blockchain would enable:

+ SONs are a new permissioned authority mechanism in the Peerplays blockchain that enables a cluster of operators to provide inter blockchain communication of Peerplays to other blockchains.
+ SONs are controlled by voters and can only operate by GPOS consensus.
+ Bitcoin sidechain from PIP#4 can be implemented into mainnet through SONs.
+ Other cryptocurrency blockchains similar to Bitcoin could be brought into mainnet.
+ Smart Contract capabilities based on any platform of choice by the Peerplays voters.
+ Increased rewards from the blockchain to support SONs in order to make the feature attractive to end users.
