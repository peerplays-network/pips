# PeerPlays Improvement Proposal

PIP stands for PeerPlays Improvement Proposal. A PIP is a design
document providing information to the PeerPlays community, or describing
a new feature for PeerPlays or its processes or environment. PIPs
provide a concise technical specification of features and a rationale
for them.

The distinct document [PIP Purpose and Guidelines](pip-0001.md) gives a
more detailed explanation.
